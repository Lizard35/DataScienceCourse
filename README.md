# DataScienceCourse
Repository for the Udacity  Data Scientist Course

## Motivation
Wrangling with data is just fun and after my company offered us the opportunity to join the udacity data scientist course, I didnâ€™t hesitate.  So what will you find in this repo? Everything related to this data scientist course. In case the assignment allows to use own data, I will do so. Because answering my own question with my own data is just more enjoyable.
